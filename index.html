      <p>The world of immigration is not short on illogical rules and there are many situations far worse
  than that of non-immigrant visa holders in the US. But this situation is getting close to no
  coverage and it could use some light. Yesterday, The New York Times published <a
    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/opinion/canada-border-americans-trudeau.html">an
    opinion piece asking Canada to open its border</a> but made no mention of the United States
  doing the same.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has been running a <em>We Can Do This</em> campaign to drive
  vaccination, arguing that vaccines can help us "<em>press play</em>" on lives put on pause by the
  pandemic. For non-immigrant visa holders, however, life remains on pause whether vaccinated or
  not. We cannot leave the country because, if we do, we don't know when we will be allowed back in.
  U.S. Consulates the world around are operating at reduced capacity, and for the most part renewing
  one's visa is near impossible.</p>
<p>This is not about tourism. I know couples who have been separated or people who haven't been able
  to meet their grandchildren for over a year. Families who found themselves stuck and had to give
  up their jobs, find a new home and new schools, and get their belongings shipped in a crash
  landing. Many have not seen their family in two years and the strain is driving some to give up on
  their lives here. Some couldn't make it over to see relatives about to pass, or rushed to do so
  and cannot return.</p>
<p>As <a
    href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/05/21/its-time-to-reopen-to-europe-and-not-just-for-tourists/">Célia
    Belin explains over at Brookings</a>, the U.S.'s travel ban is often unilateral. This isn't
  affecting a niche group nor does it have no impact on the U.S. economy at a time when increasing
  capacity is crucial: the U.S. issues millions of non-immigrant visas every year, even excluding
  temporary visitors. I know I'm having to consider the possibility that I may need to head back to
  Europe and find a new job by September, which neither I nor (to the best of my knowledge) my
  employer is excited about. At scale, the attrition in qualified workers alone could prove
  disruptive to the economy, not to mention the people.</p>
<p>It's hard to understand what the purpose of this ban is, at the very least for the vaccinated
  population. If it is indeed time to unpause our lives, it might be time, too, to walk the vax talk
  and unban.</p>
